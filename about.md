**We leverage tools from machine learning and control theory to advance our understanding of biological systems.** Our research focuses on the role of the microbiome in maintaining proper immune system function and development, as well as its impact on neurodegenerative diseases (gut-brain axis). Although specific research questions may evolve over time, a key hallmark of our work is the careful co-design of experimental and computational models. Biological systems are simply too complex to be probed through either paradigm alone.

To elucidate complex host-microbiome interactions, we often employ longitudinal (time-series) experimental study designs that allow for controlled perturbations. This approach enables us to harness the extensive set of tools developed by the dynamical systems and control theory communities over the past half-century. Additionally, we emphasize rigorous analysis of our computational models, with a portion of our work firmly rooted in pure machine learning and control theory. For more details on our research, see the [Research tab](/research/).

[//]: # (The role of the microbiome in some human diseases has long been established. One such example is its direct role as an enteric pathogen. Its role in other aspects of health and disease, however, is still being unraveled. Examples in the latter case include: food allergies, gut motility, arthritis, obesity, asthma, development of the immune system, synthesizing vitamins, maintaining proper gut barrier function, and protection against other pathogens. The recognition of the microbiomeâ€™s more prominent role in this wide range of diseases and host systems has resulted in renewed interest in developing therapies, that may have traditionally only targeted host pathways, but that now look to target the microbial contributors as well.)
