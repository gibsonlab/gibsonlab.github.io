<p>In our research we leverage tools from machine learning and control to understand biological systems.  Control theoretic concepts are integrated both in the design of our optimization schemes and statistical machine learning models, as well as in the design of our <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> experiments. Current and future projects include</p>
<ul>
  <li>Statistical learning applied to microbial dynamics (Bayesian nonparametrics, layered latent state-space models)</li>
  <li>Theoretical foundations at the intersection of machine learning and control</li>
  <li>Genetically engineering and controlling a microbial consortia</li>
  <li>Host-Microbiome interactions</li>
  <li>Time-series ‚Äúomics‚Äù (metagenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics)</li>
</ul>

<p>Gradient based optimization schemes are at the core of both adaptive control and deep learning (many of there connections are reported <a href="/papers/gaudio19cdc.pdf">here</a>). We levearge techniques used in adaptive control to improbve the stability properties of gradient algorithms resulting in <strong>provably stable</strong> momentum based accelerated algorithms. Our algorithms are a log factor slower than Nesterov but with <strong>stability guarantees</strong>, see our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01529">Higher Order Tuner</a> in Figure 1. Having <em>a priori</em> stability guarantees will be critical for certifying and deploying real-time and safety critical ML algorithms in the clinic.</p>

<p>Our main experimental system for studying the microbiome is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnotobiosis">gnotobiotic</a> mice. We are particuallary interested in developing bacterio-therapies, and to develop those therapies we need to have an experimental system that allows us to probe the dynamics of complex microbial communities <em>in vivo</em>. We colonize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ-free_animal">germ-free</a> mice with both defined communities as well as with with human fecal samples (creating ‚Äúhumanized‚Äù mice). To obtain rich dynamic profiles form the murine microbiome we perturb the microbial environment by changing the diet of the animals, presenting colonization challenges from other bacteria, delivering antibiotics, and by introducing bacteriophages. One of our experiments looking to understand the direct and indirect role of phage predation on the microbiome is shown in Figure 2 (accompanying <a href="/papers/hsu19hostmicrobe.pdf">paper</a>).</p>

<p>To answer our biological questions surrounding the microbiome we build statistical models that propogate measurements uncertainty throughout our models. One example of this is our Robust and Scalable Model of Microbiome Dynamics (Figure 3). This model is a Bayesian nonparametric model of microbial dynamics based on what we term interaction modules, or learned clusters of latent variables with redundant interaction structure. This allows our model to scale to hundreds of microbial taxa. Another example of our modeling work is the method we are referring to as Chronostrain (Figure 4) (Chronostrain). Chronostrain is a sequencing quality and sample time aware strain tracking algorithm.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2025515&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">National Science Foundation - The rules of microbiota colonization of the mammalian gut</a></strong>
 <br />
‚ÄúThis project has three main thrusts: 1) Learn microbial community-level rules that quantitatively predict population dynamics of mouse gut colonization and assess these rules across differing ranges of microbial diversity and composition, 2) Elucidate microbial gene-level mechanisms that predict mouse gut colonization dynamics, and 3) Profile microbial spatiotemporal organization and dynamics during gut colonization at the species and gene level to predict microbial community dynamics.‚Äù</p>
