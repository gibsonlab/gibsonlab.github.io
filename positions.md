**PhD students can be based at MIT or Harvard and their interests need not align with specific job openings.**

Official announcements for openings

- [Postdoctoral Fellow: Biological sequence models (theory, design, and application)](/biologicalsequence_postdoc/)
- [Postdoctoral Fellow: Learning single cell dynamics](/scdynamics_postdoc/)
- [Postdoctoral Fellow: Bacteriotherapy design, "bugs-as-drugs" (using control theory principles)](/controlmicrobiome_postdoc/)

<!---
- [Postdoctoral Fellow: Long context biological sequence models: foundations and applications](/biological_sequence_models_postdoc/)
- [Postdoctoral Fellow: Learning single cell dynamics](/single_cell_dynamics_postdoc/)

- [Postdoctoral Fellow: Host-microbiome (gut-brain axis)](/hostmicrobe_postdoc/)

Official announcements may not reflect all of our openings. Please don't hesitate to reach out because of your background. We need engineering, math, computer science, ecology, statistics, chemistry, microbiology, and much more to get these projects off the ground. See our [funding](/about/#funding) for more information on the grants supporting our work. While we are primarily a computational group all students and postdocs are encouraged to design their own experiments, that are then carried out by staff in the [host-microbiome center](https://metagenomics.partners.org/) or through our many collaborating labs. Interested graduate students, postdocs, research associates or rotation students should send cover letter and cv to <a href="mailto:tegibson@bwh.harvard.edu">tegibson@bwh.harvard.edu</a>.

<!--
Ongoing projects
- Learning microbial dynamics at scale across space and time
- Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) for applications in biology
- Bacteriotherapy design using control theory principles
- Accelerated gradient descent for real-time applications
- Experimental and computational methods for studying the gut-brain axis
- Host-microbiome interactions (wet/dry -- see below)

Opening for someone who wants to have some wet lab experience
- Time in both the Gibson Lab and the [Walt Lab](https://waltlab.bwh.harvard.edu/) developing assays for the detection of cytokines in feces ([attomolar level sensitivity](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.4c10340)), and developing models for learning host-microbiome interactions.
