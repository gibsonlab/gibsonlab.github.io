We are always looking to grow the lab. If you are interested in our work but not one of the following specific openings then still reach out (this list will not always reflect all of our openings). Also please don't hesitate to reach out because you think your background may not work. We need engineering, math, computer science, ecology, statistics, chemistry, microbiology, and much more to get these projects off the ground. See our [funding](/about/#funding) for more information on the grants supporting this work. Interested graduate students, postdocs, research associates or rotation students should send cover letter and cv to <a href="mailto:tegibson@bwh.harvard.edu">tegibson@bwh.harvard.edu</a>. For specific openings see below.

Current positions/projects potentially suitable for all ranks

- Developing robust microbial consortia (using putative interactions learned from our dynamical systems models and using control theory principles) and testing them in gnotobiotic mice.
- Provably stable and robust gradient descent algorithms for optimizing differentiable ML models with applications in Healthcare and Biology.
- Statistical machine learning models for biological time series and dynamical systems.
- Developing time and quality aware strain tracking models to study the colonization dynamics of Uropathogenic E. Coli.

We also have an opening for a research associate who wants to be 50/50 wetlab/drylab at the bench developing single molecule array assays (SIMOA) while also learning about statistical machine learning and computational biology.

- Research Associate 50/50 time with the Gibson Lab and the Walt Lab developing SIMOA assays for the detection of cytokines in feces. The candidate will also be trained in bioinformatics, statistical machine learning, and computational biology.
