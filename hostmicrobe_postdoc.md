### Host-Microbiome Postdoctoral Fellow

Opening for a Postdoctoral Research Fellow to join the [Gibson Lab](https://gibsonlab.io) at Harvard Medical School (HMS), Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. We leverage tools from machine learning and control theory to advance our understanding of biological systems. While specific research questions may evolve over time, a key hallmark of our work is the careful co-design of computational and experimental models. Biological systems are simply too complex to be probed through either paradigm alone.

For this project there will be a special emphasis on integrating new data modalities into our models for probing host-microbe interactions. A few examples include: the use of [digital ELISA](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.1641) to measure low abundance host inflammatory markers in feces (in collaboration with the [Walt Lab](https://waltlab.bwh.harvard.edu/)) as well as the use of spatial transcriptomics (e.g. Multiplexed Error-Robust FISH (MERFISH)) to obtain measurements of the spatial organization of bacteria and their local transcriptional environment.
