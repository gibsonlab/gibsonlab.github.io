### Host-Microbiome (Gut-Brain Axis) Postdoctoral Fellow

Opening for a Postdoctoral Research Fellow to join the [Gibson Lab](https://gibsonlab.io) at Harvard Medical School (HMS), Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. We leverage tools from machine learning (ML) and control theory to better understand biological systems and we are obsessed with uncertainty quantification. The gut microbiome and host-microbiome interactions are our primary areas of focus at this time. One area of particular interest to us is the gut-brain axis.

For this project there will be a special emphasis on integrating new data modalities into our models for probing host-microbe interactions. A few examples include: the use of [digital ELISA](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.1641) to measure low abundance host inflammatory markers in feces (in collaboration with the [Walt Lab](https://waltlab.bwh.harvard.edu/)) as well as the use of spatial transcriptomics (e.g. Multiplexed Error-Robust FISH (MERFISH)) to obtain measurements of the spatial organization of bacteria and their local transcriptional environment.

Other projects in the lab include the design of bacteriotherapies (bugs-as-drugs), developing methods to learn microbial dynamics at ecosystem-scale, studying the impact of phages on microbial communities, methods for tracking low abundance pathogens, and methods for integrating multiple data modalities and prior knowledge (from other studies, databases, or foundation models (e.g. Alphafold)) in time-series models. We focus on Bayesian methods that can propagate measurement uncertainty so that we can assess confidence in model parameters and to help prioritize follow-up experiments. ML techniques applied include: variational inference, Bayesian non-parametric models, discrete relaxation techniques (for making discrete models differentiable), and deep learning.
