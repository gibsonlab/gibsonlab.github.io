### Learning single cell dynamics Postdoctoral Fellow

Opening for a Postdoctoral Research Fellow to join the [Gibson Lab](https://gibsonlab.io) at Harvard Medical School (HMS), Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. We leverage tools from machine learning (ML) and control theory to better understand biological systems. While specific research questions may evolve over time, a key hallmark of our work is the careful co-design of computational and experimental models. Biological systems are simply too complex to be probed through either paradigm alone.

This specific project is focused on learning single cell dynamics from longitudinal (single cell or bulk RNA sequencing) data. You will have the freedom to explore different modeling approaches and inference paradigms. One initial approach could be to translate our model for learning microbial dynamics at scale [MDSINE2](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.14.469105) to handle RNA transcripts. Integration of multiple data modalities (e.g. bulk/single cell + spatial) will also be explored. Of axillary interest is the investigation of whether pseudotime based dynamics (inferred from individual time points) recapitulate actual dynamics as inferred from longitudinal data. For this work you will have access to some unique computing resources we have on premises in our department (32 A100s, 40 H200s, and more planned). We also have the capacity to perform *in vitro* or *in vivo* validation of model predictions.
