### Bacteriotherapy design, "bugs-as-drugs" (using control theory principles) Postdoctoral Fellow

Opening for a Postdoctoral Research Fellow to join the [Gibson Lab](https://gibsonlab.io) at Harvard Medical School (HMS), Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. We leverage tools from machine learning (ML) and control theory to better understand biological systems. While specific research questions may evolve over time, a key hallmark of our work is the careful co-design of computational and experimental models. Biological systems are simply too complex to be probed through either paradigm alone.

This specific project is focused on designing bacteriotherapies using control theory principles. Bacteriotherapies are defined communities of bacteria for use as a therapeutic, or simply stated "bugs-as-drugs". We have already completed dense time series gnotobiotic studies with humanized ([pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.469105v2)) and conventional mice ([unpublished - ongoing NSF project](/nsf_rules/)), and using models trained on that data you will design cocktails of bacteria that will then be tested in mouse experiments that will be carried out by our friends in the [Massachusetts Host Microbiome Center](https://cores.catalyst.harvard.edu/?uri_id=00000130-097b-7a38-de5a-673e80000000&tab=category&item=33&core=251). You will also have the opportunity to develop your own models for learning dynamics from longitudinal data. These new models may include using neural ODEs, integrating multiple data modalities (including spatial), or even using embeddings from large DNA sequence models as priors in the model.
