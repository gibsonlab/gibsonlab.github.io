### Staff Scientist (wet/dry) in Gibson Lab

Opening for a Staff Scientist or Senior Staff Scientist to join the Gibson Lab <https://gibsonlab.io> at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. We leverage tools from machine learning (ML) and dynamical systems theory to better understand biology. The gut microbiome is our primary area of focus at this time where we co-design our experimental and machine learning models adding key experimental components to help validate our models. The scientist in this role will design gnotobiotic mouse experiments, explore the use of new data modalities for studying host-microbiome interactions (e.g. [digital ELISA](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.1641) for detection of host cytokines in feces) and will help to design and carry out follow up experiments to validate insights from a our machine learning models. **We are obsessed with uncertainty quantification** and focus on statistical methods that propagate measurement uncertainty throughout the model so that we can access confidence in model parameters and to help prioritize follow-up experiments.

Some of our recent funding is below and you will have an active role in expanding our applications byond those covered here (e.g. gut-brain axis)
- **NIH R35GM143056** - [Machine Learning and Control Principles for Computational Biology](/r35/)
- **NIH R21AI154075** - [Tracking the microbiome: purpose-built machine learning tools for tracking microbial strains over time](/r21_tracking/)
- **NSF MTM2**- [The rules of microbiota colonization of the mammalian gut](/nsf_rules/)

**Qualifications**
- PhD (although no reason why one can't be a great scientist without one so its not absolutely necessary)
- Excellent publication track record
- Bench scientist at some point in prior life (experience designing and carrying out experiments) while also having the ability to run bioinformatics software
- Background in microbiology is a plus
- Ability to reside in the U.S. and legally work in the country.

**About the lab environment**

The Gibson Lab is located in the Division of Computational Pathology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), a Harvard Medical School teaching hospital, which is the second largest non-university recipient of NIH research funding. The broad mandate of the Division of Computational Pathology is to develop and apply advanced computational methods for furthering the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of human diseases. The Division is situated within the BWH Department of Pathology, which houses over 40+ established investigators, 50+ postdoctoral research fellows, and 100+ research support staff. In addition, BWH is part of the greater Longwood Medical Area in Boston, a rich, stimulating environment conducive to intellectual development and research collaborations, which includes the Harvard Medical School quad, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston Children’s Hospital, and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Many of our lab members also have appointments at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Broad Institute.

**Applications Process**

Submit: (1) cover letter; (2) curriculum vitae; (3) relevant publications; (4) names and contact information of three individuals who can serve as references to: Travis Gibson, tegibson@bwh.harvard.edu. If you wish to chat briefly over Zoom before submitting materials to learn more details about our ongoing work, please inquire about this possibility.
